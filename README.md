# Task 1: *software configuration*
## Subtask 1: 
##### **"Why did I choose to participate in the Dare IT Challenge?"**
###### I decided to continue studying testing and was looking for courses, saw these automated testing courses and decided to apply.
###### All my life I have been called to IT and this area interests me. My goal is to gain knowledge and experience in automated testing, get a certificate and the opportunity to find a job.
###### I expect that here in a simple and accessible language they will explain and show what automated testing is and how to do it. And I have practical experience and knowledge
###### I have high hopes for this course. Thanks!
